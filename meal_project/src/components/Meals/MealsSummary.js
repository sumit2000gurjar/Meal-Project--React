        Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you
        click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video you
        want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for the video
        that best fits your document. To make your document look professionally
        produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs
        that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover
        page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you
        want from the different galleries.

        Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To
        change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button
        for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click
        where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.
        Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts
        of the document and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop
        reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off -
        even on another device.
